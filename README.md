# tdscCupEpisode2

This Repository contains my solution for the [Tartan Data Science Cup: Episode II](http://www.stat.cmu.edu/tartandatasciencecup/). I was on a team by myself, and I [won the competition](https://twitter.com/CMU_Stats/status/785278836183367682).

The competition took place from 9 AM to 5 PM on October 9th. at 9 AM we were given the problem statement that required us to predict which households would purchase eggs using a given transaction dataset (see raw dataset in `data/raw`, described in `docs`). We were expected to submit our report at 5 PM.

The `codeNotebooks` subdirectory contains most of the code that I wrote over the 8-hour competition. The `pipeline` subdirectory contains the cleaned training and prediction pipelines for modeling on the dataset.
